This is the README for my portfolio project.

==============

TESTING

==============


-Tried on several diff phones, hauwei nova 3i (worked fine), iphone 6 () and safari integrations was having issues

both iphones tried didn't work - image "iphone-error-21-mar.png"


======

Improvements - could change the script for opening tiles etc - make it so that clicking the open box doesn't close them, only the X does

- Make about me more visual, and less text based, in fitting with the rest of the website ( this could be done by adding icons for JS, CSS etc)

ADD user feedback from nik etc in trello

- in future, make the bulk of the html first then style it

## Description of portfolio
    
### Purpose


This portfolio project was designed for several reasons. 

Firstly, it is a great way to show off projects that I have worked on, which allows myself and potential future employers to get a sense of my progress as a developer over time.

Secondly, it is a very useful exercise in learning and applying HTML and CSS skills that are extremely valuable tools to have in my web development arsenal. This project is not only useful for learning the syntax and flow of how these languages work, but also how to employ proper web design skills such that a document flows properly and is not buggy.

Finally, the project is useful for improving my project management skills, in terms of defining an appropriate solution to the brief in the given amount of time, and determining which features are necessary to achieve a Minimum Viable Product (MVP), and which are not.

### Functionality / features

The site delivers on the key requirements of the assessment, including :

    -Displaying my name and contact details
    -Listing my study and work history
    -Listing my contact information
    -Displaying a brief description of me and my personality


These 4 requirements are delivered through a minimal, functional website. The user begins at a "launch-pad" section, and there is a clickable arrow to bring them down to the main section (they can also scroll themselves).

The main section contains 4 'puzzle pieces', for the different sections of content in the site:

    -About (provides a description of me and my skills, study and work history)
    -Projects (contains a link to my github page, and 3 of my recent projects + images of said projects)
    -Blog (A link to my blog, and 3 recent posts in the same format as the projects)
    -Contact (Various ways to get in touch with me, including various social media links.)


## Sitemap

    The site's map is fairly simple as it is only a single page:

## Target audience

    The main target audience for my website is potential employers, or people that are interested in my ongoing programming and personal projects.

    The site may also be of use to fellow web development students in order to demonstrate various aspects of web deveopment.




### Tech stack (e.g. html, css, deployment platform, etc)


    The website was built using: 
        -HTML
        -CSS (vanilla css with flexbox)
        -Javascript (for scripting the squares opening and closing)
        -Github (for deployment, hosting and version control)
        -Trello (for project management)
        -Balsamiq (for mockups)

## Design


    1. Design process

    When initially presented with the assignment, I started doing some research of various websites, to see wwhich kind of style I liked. The end product ended up being fairly different, but it was still an interesting exercise in researching different styles of web design.

    I got the idea of the 'launch-pad' section at the top of the site from Matthew Williams (http://findmatthew.com/). I admired the simplicity of this feature, because it immediately tells the user what Matthew does, without any clutter:

    I also really admired the flow of SingularityNET's website, with a big hero image at the top of the page and some info on the side. I was initially going to run with this idea, but I didn't really have a logo to display.

    After getting a general idea of the look of the site, I then proceeded to make wireframes for both desktop and mobile using Balsamiq:

    [desktop wf]

    [mobile wf]

    These initial wireframes were quite similar to the singularityNET model, with a hero image appearing on the right hand side, and then various headings running down the page. I ended up combining the two in some sense, with my background image (the leaf in the hand) being the hero image, but it instead appears below the tagline (which was inspired by Matt's website).

    I then came up with the idea of having a 'puzzle piece' design, where the four pieces of the square revealed different images. I ended up going ahead with this, as I thought it suited the minimalist them of the site. Initially, I had planned to make them appear as actual puzzle pieces (with small notches on the sides), but due to lack of time, I ended up just making them regular div squares that are clickable.
